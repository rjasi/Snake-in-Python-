Just a simple "snake" game implementation in Python 3 

Version 0 features and changes
The initial uploaded file doesn't contain anything functional, only some function definitions used for later.

More information can be cound in the main source "mainv3.py" in the comments. Will move the information here when I have time

Everything works but the only thing needed is to use the next position of the snake's head to check whether if it crashed/caught a coin
