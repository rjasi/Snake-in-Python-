# Snake-in-Python-
Just a simple "snake" game implementation in Python 3 
The "SimpleGrahics" library is used only for the visual component of the program 

Version 0 features and changes
The initial uploaded file doesn't contain anything functional, only some function definitions used for later.

More information can be cound in the main source "mainv3.py" in the comments. Will move the information here when I have time

Everything works but the only thing needed is to use the next position of the snake's head to check whether if it crashed/caught a coin

Version 6: 
Everything is working prefectly.
Note: Issues may rise if the coin is spawned at the same position of one of the snake's segments. Chance is low.
